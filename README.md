# TITLE: Finding Swimmy

Description: This game is called Finding Swimmy, heavily inspired by Flappy Bird and named loosely after Finding Nemo. Through this project, I learned the C# Syntax, how to incorporate sprites, materials, different game objects, collisions, etc. all within one game. The hardest part was the game engine itself, as I was able to put the sprites and everything in the right places, but having the collisions work, the button work, referencing the correct game objects, etc was difficult.

To play: Navigate to the assets folder. Inside, open the swimmyfish file that has the unity file extension. It will open in Unity and you should be able to play!
